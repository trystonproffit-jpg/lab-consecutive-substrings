Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solution

Goal:
If given a string
    return all consecutive substrings within that string
    return in the order they appear

Pseudocode:

Function consecutiveSubstrings(string)
    create empty list called result

    for each index start from 0 to length of string -1
        for each index end from start + 1 to length of string
            create substring by slicing string from start to end
            add string to result
        end for loop
    end for loop

    return result
end the function

1. Determine which aspect is scalable by looking into variables, and 

2. Determine how that scalable element changes the code.
If the scalable element increases, how does that change the code?
Look into looping elements.

The scalable element is the length of the string that is input into the function
so n = length of the string
The string can be a single character or a million, so the input size is what scales

The larger n is the more times the outer loop runs.
The more the outer loop runs the more the inner loops runs as well
So the more n grows the more the loops will run
This creates quadratic growth so O(n^2)
